Lurker Creative Mode is a small little RPG. It requires just a GM (Game Master) who will act like a player but can have other players that aren't the GM too. The characters have two stats, ATK (Attack) and HP. ATK is chosen by the player while HP is Infinity

All player's characters start in a room that is white, it has walls, a ceiling and a floor. All players are treated with the same power as a GM gets in a normal Lurker game however only the GM can truly end the game. The door is created by the first player to want a door and all players can walk through it.

Everyone can create monsters with their own HP of their choosing. Every ATK point can be one HP point hit from a monster. The monster has an ATK of their creator's choosing too. When a player/monster attacks their ATK will be taken off the enemy's HP, (HP - ATK) however players will not die if a monster's HP goes below 0 they are dead. A player has infinte health so can't die.

Everyone can choose to heal or damage one another like with Poison Attacks (effects) or Healing Potions (items) however nobody can choose to not include them.

The GM will end the game by saying that the game is over however other players (non-GMs) can choose to leave at any time by creating an exit door.
